                <h5>i feel as though i should preface that i'm very proud of all the work i did, and the work my team did on this game.</h5>
            <h3><a href="https://gdm-studios-team-5.itch.io/cratscendo" target="_blank"> cratscendo</a> </h3>
                <p>so cratscendo was a 10ish week long project that i and 7 other team mates took on for a game competition that gamedev mcgill hosted, called GDM studios. we were given two mentors, a theme, some goals, and then we were told to make a game.
                    it was my first time ever doing this (other than the unity roll-a-ball tutorial). i learned so much from it, and it was truly an amazing experience. 
                    as far as what i worked on. i did the character art + animations as well as one of the enemies. i did the majority of 3D modeling and map design as well as a good chunk of gameplay programming.
                    i also produced weekly devlogs that were required for the competition which you can find in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH48C8LCCDj6Zr9Ym_mGlqr91lkBj6_ek" target="_blank"> playlist! </a>

                <p> i spent a weekend learning<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-html" target="_blank"> html </a>+ <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-css" target="_blank"> css </a> using codecademy. 
                    i've also been using resources online to help me learn and add to my website, for example : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank"> w3schools.</a>
                    i used github pages to launch a website using my account. i've been coding in vs code and deploying it with github desktop.
