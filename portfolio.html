            <h2> Games: </h2>
            <h3><a href="https://gdm-studios-team-5.itch.io/cratscendo" target="_blank"> cratscendo</a> </h3>
                <h5>i am extremely proud of all the work i did and the work my team did on this game.</h5>
                <p>so cratscendo was a 10ish week long project that i and 7 other team mates took on for a game competition that gamedev mcgill hosted, called GDM studios. we were given two mentors, a theme, some goals, and then we were told to make a game.
                    it was my first time ever doing this (other than the unity roll-a-ball tutorial). i learned so much from it, and it was truly an amazing experience. 
                    as far as what i worked on. i did the all character art + animations as well as one of the enemies. i did the majority of 3D modeling and map design as well as a good chunk of gameplay programming.
                    i also produced weekly devlogs that were required for the competition which you can find in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH48C8LCCDj6Zr9Ym_mGlqr91lkBj6_ek" target="_blank"> playlist! </a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>gameplay programming wise, since i was on a team with 6 other programmers, there isn't really something that only i worked on. we really all bounced work off each other, and helped to improve and integrate what others had already worked on.
                    i did originally design the health system as well as a few of the rat attacks. i made the collectibles (3D models + programming). I also designed the room mechanics, such as when the doors close and open, including everything adjacent to that. otherwise
                    i mainly helped to improve and add on to pre-existing code to help our project run smoothly!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> for this project, i managed to learn 3D modeling, pixel art, animation, and a lot more about the intricacies of game design and programming.</p>
                <br>
                <p> here you can see through a bunch of my animations! : </p>

                <p> finally finished this! just a little something i've been working on for fun and build game experience. (i really like bears) </p>
                <br>
                <p> this is my first 2D game, and i feel like i learned a good bit from it. i made everything except for the sound and one picture at the end. i grew more confident in my art skills as well as my programming skills. also, just my ability in unity in general. </p>
                <br>
                <p>here's some art i did for it :) </p>

                <p> i spent a weekend learning<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-html" target="_blank"> html </a>+ <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-css" target="_blank"> css </a> using codecademy. 
                    i've also been using resources online to help me learn and add to my website, for example : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank"> w3schools.</a>
                    i used github pages to launch a website using my account. i've been coding in vs code and deploying it with github desktop.
