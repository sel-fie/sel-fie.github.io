                <h2><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
                <p>welcome to my website!! my name is sofie, and i'm a computer science student at McGill University. I'm going into my 3rd year with a specialty in games and a minor in mathematics.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>i'm very involved in my school's game development club <a href="https://gamedevmcgill.ca/" target="_blank">(gamedev mcgill)</a>, and this year i'll be one of the VP Communications! </p>
                <br>
                <p>this website is my first project using css + html so it might look a little rough... </p>
                <br>
                <p>i love caffiene, geeking out on video games, music, running, and math!</p>
                <br>

                <h2><strong>MORE ABOUT ME (if you're really curious) </strong></h2>
                <h3> let's see... if you really want to know more...</h3>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> i love the fine arts. i go out of my way to see the symphony and go to art museums. i enjoy video games (sometimes a little too much). i'm currently playing
                    red dead redemption two, if any rockstar games recruiter sees this... i love your game. anyways, let's see, i've played the flute for a little over ten years
                    now and i like to paint with gouache. i love colors and maximalism, which is really hard to do on this website 
                    since i'm not incredibly experienced.
                </p>
